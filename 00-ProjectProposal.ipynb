    "As the world continues to see the intersection of human ingenuity and technological accumulation grow extremely rapidly, this shift in the corporate landscape can be tied back to a specific niche: the prevalence and growth of startups in the post-modern era. As technical knowledge and tools continue to develop, human ingenuity has found itself employed in finding the most useful ways to leverage and expand upon the current era of technology and artificial intelligence. Examples of post-modern startups include Uber, Robinhood, Stripe, Databricks, Canva, and Slack. Ideas for growth and innovation stem from all fields, and are catalyzed from a variety of sources such as corporate America, educational insititutions, and small communities all across the country. However, although the majority of the startups known today are those that found success in climbing the barrier between idea and impact, it is the majority that fall short of overcoming this hurdle and end up failing as a product. In this report, we aim to look at a multitude of variables directly and intrinsically tied to startups and their growth, to determine the coefficient of correlation between various factors such as industry sector, funding, location, and size, and how they impact a startup's ability to come to fruition. Because the growth of startups is relatively new and tied to very modern technological advancements, there is a scarce amount of research done into the causes behind their success and failures. For example, venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as Y Combinator were founded in 2005, making the funding rounds for successful startups a very new principle. Our curiosity lies in looking at the underlying details of the successes and failures for startups in the United States, as it provides an opportunity to discover findings in a modern niche that does not possess the level of academic study that other corporate fields in America do.\n"

    "\n",
    "This dataset contains firm-level records for startups with core attributes that complement the Crunchbase outcomes file: basic identity (e.g., name), sector tags (labels), geography (city, state_code), temporal markers (founded_at, closed_at), funding fields (e.g., funding_total_usd, first_funding_at, last_funding_at, funding_rounds), and current status. After basic de-duplication and cleaning, the file provides 922 unique companies and 49 variables—an efficient “attributes & sectors” snapshot that pairs naturally with the Crunchbase outcomes table for modeling both likelihood and timing of failure vs. acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important metrics & units (what they mean):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Funding totals ('funding_total_usd', USD)**: aggregate capital raised. These values are heavy-tailed (a few very large rounds); use log1p or winsorization in modeling. Medians are typically much lower than means.\n",
    "- **Funding intensity('funding_rounds', count; 'first_funding_at' / 'last_funding_at', dates)**: approximates investor traction and recency of financing activity.\n",
    "- **Timing ('founded_at', 'closed_at', dates)**: used to compute durations like time-to-failure/acquisition in survival or competing-risks framing.\n",
    "- **Geography ('city', 'state_code')**: can be standardized to region/country to analyze spatial effects (ecosystem maturity, capital access).\n",
    "- **Outcome label ('status')**: maps to success (acquired/IPO), failure (closed), or censored (operating/active).\n",
    "\n",
    "Major Concerns with the Dataset:\n",
    "- Self-selection and visibility bias: The dataset mainly includes startups with a public presence or enough significance to have their information recorded online. Smaller or short-lived companies that failed early are likely missing. As a result, the data overrepresents well-funded or high-profile firms, creating a visibility bias that favors more successful ventures and underrepresents smaller or less visible startups.\n",
    "- Geographic and sector imbalance: The dataset is heavily concentrated in major tech hubs like San Francisco, New York, and London, while smaller or emerging regions are underrepresented. It also overrepresents technology-focused industries such as software, e-commerce, and fintech, limiting how broadly the results can be applied to other sectors.\n",
    "- Survivorship bias and reporting lag: Active or successful startups are more likely to update their data, while failed or older companies are underrepresented, creating survivorship bias. Reporting delays for closures or acquisitions may also cause the dataset to miss recent outcomes."

    "### Dataset #2 — Crunchbase Startup Outcomes (Failure vs. Acquisition)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains company-level records from Crunchbase with profile attributes (name, industry/category), geography (country, region/city), funding history (total USD raised, number of rounds, last funding date), and outcome indicators (operating, acquired, IPO, closed) with event timestamps. It directly supports our hypothesis by enabling both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Likelihood modeling: whether a startup ultimately fails (closed) or is successfully exited (acquired/IPO).\n",
    "- Timing modeling: how long it takes from founding to failure vs. acquisition (time-to-event).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope and variables aligned to the hypothesis:\n",
    "- **Funding size and intensity**: `funding_total_usd` (USD, heavy‑tailed), `funding_rounds` (count), `last_funding_at` (recency control).\n",
    "- **Industry sector**: `category`/`industry`/`category_list` (will standardize to a consistent taxonomy and allow multi-label handling when needed).\n",
    "- **Geographic location**: `country`/`country_code`, `region`/`city` (we will normalize to country and, when available, region for stratification).\n",
    "- **Outcomes and timing**: `status` plus event dates `acquired_at`, `closed_at`, and baseline `founded_at` to compute durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome coding and analysis framing:\n",
    "- **Success**: acquired or IPO.\n",
    "- **Failure**: closed.\n",
    "- **Censored**: operating/active at last observation (no terminal event yet).\n",
    "- We will treat timing via survival/competing‑risks framing: time from `founded_at` to first terminal event (acquisition or closure), censoring otherwise. This supports estimating how funding, sector, and geography shift both hazards and ultimate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key data characteristics and handling notes:\n",
    "- **Heavy tails in funding**: consider log1p transform or winsorization; flag extreme outliers for sensitivity checks.\n",
    "- **Sector taxonomy**: categories are noisy/inconsistent; we will collapse to a manageable hierarchy (e.g., top‑level sector groups).\n",
    "- **Geographic normalization**: standardize country codes; map regions/cities to country, and use region only when coverage is sufficient.\n",
    "- **Missingness**: dates and categories can be absent; we will profile missingness, document imputation/dropping rules, and avoid introducing informative censoring.\n",
    "- **Entity resolution**: de‑duplicate by exact rows and harmonized `name`; spot‑check ambiguous entities.\n",
    "- **Coverage bias**: Crunchbase coverage varies by sector, geography, and stage; we will include cohort/time fixed effects where needed and report limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrangling plan(TBD, can be altered...):\n",
    "- Load from `data/00-raw/`, standardize column names and types, parse dates, harmonize sector and geography, derive `outcome_label` and `time_to_event_days`, flag funding outliers, and export an analysis‑ready file to `data/02-processed/` for modeling likelihood and timing of failure vs. acquisition."

"- **Bias & fairness:** Datasets may favor startups or sectors that are much higher in popularity and show a bias towards well known startups. There are also concerns with issues of generlzation as some areas may have high density of startups compared to others potential misrepresenting the data.\n",
"- **Generalization limits:** As mentioned previously, Kaggle datasets in particular may overrepresent high success startups due to the ease of accessing the data. This results in the data not geenrlazaing to non-tech or smaller companies. We intend to avoid general claims and make specifc statements that are contextualized by environment maturity.\n",
"- **Data sensitivity:** Although the data gathered is public, names and emails can be used to reidenifty an individual, or any specific data points that can be used to triangulate a person or startup. \n",
"- **Non-Consensual Use of Company Information:** Despite the data being public, startups in the dataset did not consent to be analyzed or used for prediction exercises. We will be using aggregated analysis and not single out any companies.\n",
"- **Potential Misrepresentation Due to Inaccurate or Incomplete Data:** Startup databases are often incomplete, outdated, or wrong because the data is crowdsourced. We will treat the data as approximate and emphasize uncertainty rather than presenting results as definitive truth.\n",
"- **Responsibility to Prevent Harmful Use of Results:** If someone misuses the findings it may influence funding or hiring decisions, or perceptions of certain industries/regions. We will explicitly state that the work should not be used for investment decisions.\n"

    "In regard to communication, we plan on using iMessage to text one another. We believe this is one of the most efficient and easiest ways for us to contact one another. As for the  messaging itself, all members have agreed to expect a response, whether that be a message or a reaction, from each group member within 3 hours of the initial text being sent. We will meet twice per week, every Monday morning, we will reserve a study space in the Geisel Library to meet and provide updates, followed by a Zoom meeting every Friday afternoon to consolidate the designated progress from Monday's meeting. In regard to tone, we agree to all expect respectful interactions. Even when a disagreement takes place, the person expressing a lack of approval should explain their reasoning, as well as an alternative method that they believe is better. We will be concise and to the point, but still maintain respect for one another and everyone's ideas. We plan to use voting to make decisions as a group, especially for disagreements and changes to our original plan. The project administrator will be in charge of calling the vote, and we will go with the majority ruling, as we have 5 people. We will not accept abstaining from votes. We have specialized roles for each person; however, because there is overlap, we do plan to share many of the responsibilities. As we are a team, we plan on helping each other out when possible, especially if one person is struggling with a specific task. We assign roles and tasks based on the skillsets of the members, which we have already discussed in detail. We have set a policy that struggles are inevitable, as we are all busy. We have a guideline that whenever someone is falling behind, there is no hassle or problem in expressing that as early as possible. We would rather know what to fix earlier in the process, rather than have a last-minute lack of execution. Struggles with certain tasks should be expressed immediately, as we will set egos aside to help regardless of role/assigned tasks, in order to prioritize the team as a unit/whole.\n"
