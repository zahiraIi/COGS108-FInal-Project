### Dataset #1 — [Give this dataset a short descriptive name]

This dataset contains [brief description].

Scope and variables aligned to the project hypothesis:

- Important variables and notes:
  - id / name — unique company identifier or name (string).
  - date / year — observation date (ISO date or year).
  - metric_1_name — description (units).
  - metric_2_name — description (units).
  - funding_total_usd — total funding raised in USD (numeric, heavy‑tailed).
  - category / industry — company sector tags (string or list).
  - country / region — geographic location (country code or name).

Key data characteristics and handling notes:

- Missingness: profile missingness per column and consider how missingness may bias analyses (e.g., smaller firms underreported).
- Measurement issues: inconsistent units or currencies, free-text categories, and possible duplicate rows.
- Coverage bias: source-dependent geographic/sector skew (e.g., stronger coverage for US/tech startups).
- Time lag / label noise: event dates (closed/acquired) may be updated with delay.

Wrangling plan (TBD, can be altered):

- Load from `data/00-raw/`, standardize column names and types, parse dates, harmonize sector and geography, derive `outcome_label` and `time_to_event_days`, flag funding outliers, and export processed files to `data/02-processed/`.

Guidance for the code cell that follows:

- Load the raw CSV from `data/00-raw/`.
- Standardize column names to snake_case.
- Parse and coerce date fields; derive canonical `founded_at` and event dates.
- Coerce funding and numeric fields to numeric (remove $/commas) and consider log1p-transform for modeling.
- De-duplicate by canonical id or normalized name; keep the first/best row.
- Provide diagnostics: shape, column missingness (%), data types, funding quantiles, and outlier counts.
- Save interim and processed outputs to `data/01-interim/` and `data/02-processed/` respectively.

Minimal reproducible checks to include:

- Display head() and dtypes after loading.
- Print missingness per column (pct).
- Print counts of unique companies and duplicates removed.
- Print funding quantiles and number of IQR outliers flagged.

Suggested accompanying text after the code cell:

- "After the wrangling steps we keep N rows and M columns. Columns X,Y,Z had >50% missing and are dropped/imputed as follows: ... Funding was log1p-transformed and outliers flagged using IQR bounds (lower=L, upper=U)."
