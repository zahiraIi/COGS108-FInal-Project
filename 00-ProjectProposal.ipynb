## Research Question
How do funding size, industry sector, and geographic location influence both the likelihood and timing of startup failure versus acquisition?


## Background and Prior Work
As the world continues to see the intersection of human ingenuity and technological accumulation grow extremely rapidly, this shift in the corporate landscape can be tied back to a specific niche: the prevalence and growth of startups in the post-modern era. As technical knowledge and tools continue to develop, human ingenuity has found itself employed in finding the most useful ways to leverage and expand upon the current era of technology and artificial intelligence. Examples of post-modern startups include Uber, Robinhood, Stripe, Databricks, Canva, and Slack. Ideas for growth and innovation stem from all fields, and are catalyzed from a variety of sources such as corporate America, educational insititutions, and small communities all across the country. However, although the majority of the startups known today are those that found success in climbing the barrier between idea and impact, it is the majority that fall short of overcoming this hurdle and end up failing as a product. In this report, we aim to look at a multitude of variables directly and intrinsically tied to startups and their growth, to determine the coefficient of correlation between various factors such as industry sector, funding, location, and size, and how they impact a startup's ability to come to fruition. Because the growth of startups is relatively new and tied to very modern technological advancements, there is a scarce amount of research done into the causes behind their success and failures. For example, venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as Y Combinator were founded in 2005, making the funding rounds for successful startups a very new principle. Our curiosity lies in looking at the underlying details of the successes and failures for startups in the United States, as it provides an opportunity to discover findings in a modern niche that does not possess the level of academic study that other corporate fields in America do.

## Hypothesis

Startups with larger funding sizes, operating in high-growth industry sectors, and located within established entrepreneurial ecosystems are less likely to fail and tend to experience longer survival times before either failure or acquisition, whereas startups with smaller funding, in low-growth sectors, or in emerging regions face higher failure risks and shorter time-to-event durations. 

## Data
### Data overview

- **Dataset #1**
- **Dataset Name**: Startup Success Prediction
  - **Link to the dataset**: 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkc06/startup-success-prediction/data'
  - **Number of observations**: 922 
  - **Number of variables**: 49 
  - **Most relevant variables for our project**:
    - Name/ID: name (entity key used for de-duplication)
    - Industry/Sector: labels (needs standardization to top-level sector groups)
    - Geography: e.g., city, state_code (normalize to country/region for stratification)
    - Funding: e.g., funding_total_usd, first_funding_at, last_funding_at, funding_rounds (USD; heavy-tailed; consider log/winsorization)
    - Outcome/Status: status (map to success/failure/censored)
    - Timing: founded_at, closed_at (parsed to datetime for time to event metrics)
  - **Shortcomings / caveats**:
    - Sector taxonomy in labels is noisy; requires collapsing to a consistent hierarchy
    - Coverage/selection bias (by region/state/stage) likely; report as limitation and consider cohort/time controls
    - Event labeling: status may lag reality; treat "operating" as censored in survival framing
    - Date gaps: Missing founded_at/closed_at can bias time-to-event; document drop/impute rules


- **Dataset #2**
  - **Dataset Name**: Big Startup Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase
  - **Link to the dataset**: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yanmaksi/big-startup-secsees-fail-dataset-from-crunchbase`
  - **Number of observations**: Computed in the code cell below (after loading)
  - **Number of variables**: Computed in the code cell below (after loading)
  - **Most relevant variables for our project**:
    - Funding-related: `funding_total_usd` (or similar), `funding_rounds`, `last_funding_at`
    - Outcome/status: `status` (e.g., acquired/ipo/operating/closed), `acquired_at`, `closed_at`
    - Company profile: `name`, `category`/`industry`, `country`, `region`/`city`, `num_employees`
    - Timing: `founded_at` (and event dates as above) for computing time-to-failure or time-to-acquisition
  - **Shortcomings / caveats**:
    - Potential label noise: outcomes may be simplified; “operating” does not guarantee long-term success; “closed” labels may lag reality
    - Missing or inconsistent dates across companies, which affects survival/time-to-event analyses
    - Possible duplicates or multiple rows for the same company over time; category/industry taxonomy can be messy
    - Survivorship and reporting bias inherent to Crunchbase; geographic and sector coverage is uneven

If we combine datasets, we will align on common keys (e.g., standardized company names and/or website domains), and normalize geography (country/region) and industry taxonomies before joining.

### Dataset #1 — Startup Attributes & Sectors (Uploaded File)

- **What it is**: 922 startups × 49 columns with identity, sector tags, geography, funding, timing, and status.
- **Why it matters**: Complements Crunchbase outcomes; gives clean attributes for joining and modeling.
- **Key fields**: `name`, `labels` (sector), `city`, `state_code`, `funding_total_usd`, `funding_rounds`, `first_funding_at`, `last_funding_at`, `founded_at`, `closed_at`, `status`.
- **Quality notes**: Some sector and date noise; mild geographic imbalance; heavy‑tailed funding.
- **Usage**: Feature engineering and cross‑dataset join keys; baseline EDA on funding/sector/location.

### Dataset #2 — Crunchbase Startup Outcomes (Failure vs. Acquisition)

- **What it is**: ~66k startups with profile, funding history, geography, and outcome labels (`operating`, `acquired`, `ipo`, `closed`).
- **Why it matters**: Core table for outcome modeling (success vs. failure) and time‑to‑event analysis.
- **Key fields**: `name`, `category_list` → `industry_primary`, `country_code`/`state_code`/`region`/`city`, `funding_total_usd`, `funding_rounds`, `first_funding_at`, `last_funding_at`, `founded_at`, `acquired_at`, `closed_at`, `status`.
- **Quality notes**: Heavy‑tailed funding; noisy/heterogeneous categories; some missing/lagged event dates.
- **Usage**: Derive `outcome_label` (success/failure/censored), compute `time_to_event_days`, profile geography/industry, and export cleaned CSV for modeling.

    "As the world continues to see the intersection of human ingenuity and technological accumulation grow extremely rapidly, this shift in the corporate landscape can be tied back to a specific niche: the prevalence and growth of startups in the post-modern era. As technical knowledge and tools continue to develop, human ingenuity has found itself employed in finding the most useful ways to leverage and expand upon the current era of technology and artificial intelligence. Examples of post-modern startups include Uber, Robinhood, Stripe, Databricks, Canva, and Slack. Ideas for growth and innovation stem from all fields, and are catalyzed from a variety of sources such as corporate America, educational insititutions, and small communities all across the country. However, although the majority of the startups known today are those that found success in climbing the barrier between idea and impact, it is the majority that fall short of overcoming this hurdle and end up failing as a product. In this report, we aim to look at a multitude of variables directly and intrinsically tied to startups and their growth, to determine the coefficient of correlation between various factors such as industry sector, funding, location, and size, and how they impact a startup's ability to come to fruition. Because the growth of startups is relatively new and tied to very modern technological advancements, there is a scarce amount of research done into the causes behind their success and failures. For example, venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as Y Combinator were founded in 2005, making the funding rounds for successful startups a very new principle. Our curiosity lies in looking at the underlying details of the successes and failures for startups in the United States, as it provides an opportunity to discover findings in a modern niche that does not possess the level of academic study that other corporate fields in America do.\n"

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### Dataset #2 — Crunchbase Startup Outcomes (Failure vs. Acquisition)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains company-level records from Crunchbase with profile attributes (name, industry/category), geography (country, region/city), funding history (total USD raised, number of rounds, last funding date), and outcome indicators (operating, acquired, IPO, closed) with event timestamps. It directly supports our hypothesis by enabling both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Likelihood modeling: whether a startup ultimately fails (closed) or is successfully exited (acquired/IPO).\n",
    "- Timing modeling: how long it takes from founding to failure vs. acquisition (time-to-event).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope and variables aligned to the hypothesis:\n",
    "- **Funding size and intensity**: `funding_total_usd` (USD, heavy‑tailed), `funding_rounds` (count), `last_funding_at` (recency control).\n",
    "- **Industry sector**: `category`/`industry`/`category_list` (will standardize to a consistent taxonomy and allow multi-label handling when needed).\n",
    "- **Geographic location**: `country`/`country_code`, `region`/`city` (we will normalize to country and, when available, region for stratification).\n",
    "- **Outcomes and timing**: `status` plus event dates `acquired_at`, `closed_at`, and baseline `founded_at` to compute durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome coding and analysis framing:\n",
    "- **Success**: acquired or IPO.\n",
    "- **Failure**: closed.\n",
    "- **Censored**: operating/active at last observation (no terminal event yet).\n",
    "- We will treat timing via survival/competing‑risks framing: time from `founded_at` to first terminal event (acquisition or closure), censoring otherwise. This supports estimating how funding, sector, and geography shift both hazards and ultimate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key data characteristics and handling notes:\n",
    "- **Heavy tails in funding**: consider log1p transform or winsorization; flag extreme outliers for sensitivity checks.\n",
    "- **Sector taxonomy**: categories are noisy/inconsistent; we will collapse to a manageable hierarchy (e.g., top‑level sector groups).\n",
    "- **Geographic normalization**: standardize country codes; map regions/cities to country, and use region only when coverage is sufficient.\n",
    "- **Missingness**: dates and categories can be absent; we will profile missingness, document imputation/dropping rules, and avoid introducing informative censoring.\n",
    "- **Entity resolution**: de‑duplicate by exact rows and harmonized `name`; spot‑check ambiguous entities.\n",
    "- **Coverage bias**: Crunchbase coverage varies by sector, geography, and stage; we will include cohort/time fixed effects where needed and report limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrangling plan(TBD, can be altered...):\n",
    "- Load from `data/00-raw/`, standardize column names and types, parse dates, harmonize sector and geography, derive `outcome_label` and `time_to_event_days`, flag funding outliers, and export an analysis‑ready file to `data/02-processed/` for modeling likelihood and timing of failure vs. acquisition."

    "- **Bias & fairness:** Datasets may favor startups or sectors that are much higher in popularity and show a bias towards well known startups. There are also concerns with issues of generlzation as some areas may have high density of startups compared to others potential misrepresenting the data.\n",
    "- **Generalization limits:** As mentioned previously, Kaggle datasets in particular may overrepresent high success startups due to the ease of accessing the data. This results in the data not geenrlazaing to non-tech or smaller companies. We intend to avoid general claims and make specifc statements that are contextualized by environment maturity.\n",
    "- **Data sensitivity:** Although the data gathered is public, names and emails can be used to reidenifty an individual, or any specific data points that can be used to triangulate a person or startup. \n",
    "- **Non-Consensual Use of Company Information:** Despite the data being public, startups in the dataset did not consent to be analyzed or used for prediction exercises. We will be using aggregated analysis and not single out any companies.\n",
    "- **Potential Misrepresentation Due to Inaccurate or Incomplete Data:** Startup databases are often incomplete, outdated, or wrong because the data is crowdsourced. We will treat the data as approximate and emphasize uncertainty rather than presenting results as definitive truth.\n",
    "- **Responsibility to Prevent Harmful Use of Results:** If someone misuses the findings it may influence funding or hiring decisions, or perceptions of certain industries/regions. We will explicitly state that the work should not be used for investment decisions.\n"

    "In regards to communication, we plan on using iMessage to text one another. We believe this is one of the most efficient and easiest ways for us to contact one another. As for the ,essaging itself, all members have agreed to expect a rresponse, whether that be a message or a reaction, from each group member within 3 hours of the initial text being sent. We will meet twice per week, every Monday morning we will reserve a study space in the Geisel Library to meet and prodvide updates, followed by a Zoom meetimng every Friday afternoon to consolidate the designated progress from Onday's meeting. In regarcs to tone, we agree to all expect respectful interactions. Even when disagreement takes place, the person expressing the lack of approval should explain their reasonibg, as well as an alkternative method that they beleive is better. We will be concise and to the point, but still maintaining respect for one another and everyone's ideas. We plan to use voting to make decisions as a group, especially for disagreements and changes to our original plan. The project administrator will be in charge of calling teh vote, ad we will go with the majority ruling, as wel have3 5 people. We will not accept abstaining from votes. We do have specialized roles for each person, hwoever, because there is overlap, we do plan to share a lot of the responsibilties. As we are a team, we plan on heloing each other out when possible, especially if one person is struggling with a specific task. We assign roles and tasks based on the skillsets of the members, which we have laready discussed in detail. We have set a policy that struggles are inevitbale, as we are all busy. We have a guideline that whenever someone is falling behind, there is no hassle or problem in expressing that as early as possible. We would rather know what to fix earlier on in the process, rather than have a last minute lack of execution. Struggles with certain tasks hoild be expressd immediately, as we will set egos aside ti help regardless of role/assignned tasks, in roder to priotitize the team as a unit/whole.\n"
