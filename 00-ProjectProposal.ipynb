## Research Question
How do funding size, industry sector, and geographic location influence both the likelihood and timing of startup failure versus acquisition?


## Background and Prior Work
As the world continues to see the intersection of human ingenuity and technological accumulation grow extremely rapidly, this shift in the corporate landscape can be tied back to a specific niche: the prevalence and growth of startups in the post-modern era. As technical knowledge and tools continue to develop, human ingenuity has found itself employed in finding the most useful ways to leverage and expand upon the current era of technology and artificial intelligence. Examples of post-modern startups include Uber, Robinhood, Stripe, Databricks, Canva, and Slack. Ideas for growth and innovation stem from all fields, and are catalyzed from a variety of sources such as corporate America, educational insititutions, and small communities all across the country. However, although the majority of the startups known today are those that found success in climbing the barrier between idea and impact, it is the majority that fall short of overcoming this hurdle and end up failing as a product. In this report, we aim to look at a multitude of variables directly and intrinsically tied to startups and their growth, to determine the coefficient of correlation between various factors such as industry sector, funding, location, and size, and how they impact a startup's ability to come to fruition. Because the growth of startups is relatively new and tied to very modern technological advancements, there is a scarce amount of research done into the causes behind their success and failures. For example, venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as Y Combinator were founded in 2005, making the funding rounds for successful startups a very new principle. Our curiosity lies in looking at the underlying details of the successes and failures for startups in the United States, as it provides an opportunity to discover findings in a modern niche that does not possess the level of academic study that other corporate fields in America do.

## Hypothesis

Startups with larger funding sizes, operating in high-growth industry sectors, and located within established entrepreneurial ecosystems are less likely to fail and tend to experience longer survival times before either failure or acquisition, whereas startups with smaller funding, in low-growth sectors, or in emerging regions face higher failure risks and shorter time-to-event durations. 

## Data
### Data overview

- **Dataset #1**
- **Dataset Name**: Startup Success Prediction
  - **Link to the dataset**: 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkc06/startup-success-prediction/data'
  - **Number of observations**: 922 
  - **Number of variables**: 49 
  - **Most relevant variables for our project**:
    - Name/ID: name (entity key used for de-duplication)
    - Industry/Sector: labels (needs standardization to top-level sector groups)
    - Geography: e.g., city, state_code (normalize to country/region for stratification)
    - Funding: e.g., funding_total_usd, first_funding_at, last_funding_at, funding_rounds (USD; heavy-tailed; consider log/winsorization)
    - Outcome/Status: status (map to success/failure/censored)
    - Timing: founded_at, closed_at (parsed to datetime for time to event metrics)
  - **Shortcomings / caveats**:
    - Sector taxonomy in labels is noisy; requires collapsing to a consistent hierarchy
    - Coverage/selection bias (by region/state/stage) likely; report as limitation and consider cohort/time controls
    - Event labeling: status may lag reality; treat "operating" as censored in survival framing
    - Date gaps: Missing founded_at/closed_at can bias time-to-event; document drop/impute rules


- **Dataset #2**
  - **Dataset Name**: Big Startup Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase
  - **Link to the dataset**: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yanmaksi/big-startup-secsees-fail-dataset-from-crunchbase`
  - **Number of observations**: Computed in the code cell below (after loading)
  - **Number of variables**: Computed in the code cell below (after loading)
  - **Most relevant variables for our project**:
    - Funding-related: `funding_total_usd` (or similar), `funding_rounds`, `last_funding_at`
    - Outcome/status: `status` (e.g., acquired/ipo/operating/closed), `acquired_at`, `closed_at`
    - Company profile: `name`, `category`/`industry`, `country`, `region`/`city`, `num_employees`
    - Timing: `founded_at` (and event dates as above) for computing time-to-failure or time-to-acquisition
  - **Shortcomings / caveats**:
    - Potential label noise: outcomes may be simplified; “operating” does not guarantee long-term success; “closed” labels may lag reality
    - Missing or inconsistent dates across companies, which affects survival/time-to-event analyses
    - Possible duplicates or multiple rows for the same company over time; category/industry taxonomy can be messy
    - Survivorship and reporting bias inherent to Crunchbase; geographic and sector coverage is uneven

If we combine datasets, we will align on common keys (e.g., standardized company names and/or website domains), and normalize geography (country/region) and industry taxonomies before joining.

### Dataset #1 — Startup Attributes & Sectors (Uploaded File)

- **What it is**: 922 startups × 49 columns with identity, sector tags, geography, funding, timing, and status.
- **Why it matters**: Complements Crunchbase outcomes; gives clean attributes for joining and modeling.
- **Key fields**: `name`, `labels` (sector), `city`, `state_code`, `funding_total_usd`, `funding_rounds`, `first_funding_at`, `last_funding_at`, `founded_at`, `closed_at`, `status`.
- **Quality notes**: Some sector and date noise; mild geographic imbalance; heavy‑tailed funding.
- **Usage**: Feature engineering and cross‑dataset join keys; baseline EDA on funding/sector/location.

### Dataset #2 — Crunchbase Startup Outcomes (Failure vs. Acquisition)

- **What it is**: ~66k startups with profile, funding history, geography, and outcome labels (`operating`, `acquired`, `ipo`, `closed`).
- **Why it matters**: Core table for outcome modeling (success vs. failure) and time‑to‑event analysis.
- **Key fields**: `name`, `category_list` → `industry_primary`, `country_code`/`state_code`/`region`/`city`, `funding_total_usd`, `funding_rounds`, `first_funding_at`, `last_funding_at`, `founded_at`, `acquired_at`, `closed_at`, `status`.
- **Quality notes**: Heavy‑tailed funding; noisy/heterogeneous categories; some missing/lagged event dates.
- **Usage**: Derive `outcome_label` (success/failure/censored), compute `time_to_event_days`, profile geography/industry, and export cleaned CSV for modeling.

## Ethics
- **Bias & fairness:** Datasets may favor startups or sectors that are much higher in popularity and show a bias towards well known startups. There are also concerns with issues of generlzation as some areas may have high density of startups compared to others potential misrepresenting the data.
- **Generalization limits:** As mentioned previously, Kaggle datasets in particular may overrepresent high success startups due to the ease of accessing the data. This results in the data not geenrlazaing to non-tech or smaller companies. We intend to avoid general claims and make specifc statements that are contextualized by environment maturity.
- **Data sensitivity:** Although the data gathered is public, names and emails can be used to reidenifty an individual, or any specific data points that can be used to triangulate a person or startup. 
- **Non-Consensual Use of Company Information:** Despite the data being public, startups in the dataset did not consent to be analyzed or used for prediction exercises. We will be using aggregated analysis and not single out any companies.
- **Potential Misrepresentation Due to Inaccurate or Incomplete Data:** Startup databases are often incomplete, outdated, or wrong because the data is crowdsourced. We will treat the data as approximate and emphasize uncertainty rather than presenting results as definitive truth.
- **Responsibility to Prevent Harmful Use of Results:** If someone misuses the findings it may influence funding or hiring decisions, or perceptions of certain industries/regions. We will explicitly state that the work should not be used for investment decisions.

## Team Expectations 
In regard to communication, we plan on using iMessage to text one another. We believe this is one of the most efficient and easiest ways for us to contact one another. As for the  messaging itself, all members have agreed to expect a response, whether that be a message or a reaction, from each group member within 3 hours of the initial text being sent. We will meet twice per week, every Monday morning, we will reserve a study space in the Geisel Library to meet and provide updates, followed by a Zoom meeting every Friday afternoon to consolidate the designated progress from Monday's meeting. In regard to tone, we agree to all expect respectful interactions. Even when a disagreement takes place, the person expressing a lack of approval should explain their reasoning, as well as an alternative method that they believe is better. We will be concise and to the point, but still maintain respect for one another and everyone's ideas. We plan to use voting to make decisions as a group, especially for disagreements and changes to our original plan. The project administrator will be in charge of calling the vote, and we will go with the majority ruling, as we have 5 people. We will not accept abstaining from votes. We have specialized roles for each person; however, because there is overlap, we do plan to share many of the responsibilities. As we are a team, we plan on helping each other out when possible, especially if one person is struggling with a specific task. We assign roles and tasks based on the skillsets of the members, which we have already discussed in detail. We have set a policy that struggles are inevitable, as we are all busy. We have a guideline that whenever someone is falling behind, there is no hassle or problem in expressing that as early as possible. We would rather know what to fix earlier in the process, rather than have a last-minute lack of execution. Struggles with certain tasks should be expressed immediately, as we will set egos aside to help regardless of role/assigned tasks, in order to prioritize the team as a unit/whole.

## Project Timeline Proposal
Monday, Week 3: Meeting to go over each member's final proposal for the idea they would like to put forward
Friday, Week 3: Zoom meeting to vote on the final project idea decision.
Sunday, Week 3: Zoom meeting to discuss roles and consolidate datasets that each member has found
Monday, Week 4: Meeting in Geisel Library to consolidate datasets, and to assign roles for the project proposal. Begin working on data cleaning and transformations, and design plans for visualizations.
Wednesday, Week 4: Proofread entire proposal, tighten up wording and presentation.
