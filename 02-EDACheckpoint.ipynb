    "As the world continues to see the intersection of human ingenuity and technological accumulation grow extremely rapidly, this shift in the corporate landscape can be tied back to a specific niche: the prevalence and growth of startups in the post-modern era. As technical knowledge and tools continue to develop, human ingenuity has found itself employed in finding the most useful ways to leverage and expand upon the current era of technology and artificial intelligence. Examples of post-modern startups include Uber, Robinhood, Stripe, Databricks, Canva, and Slack. Ideas for growth and innovation stem from all fields, and are catalyzed from a variety of sources such as corporate America, educational insititutions, and small communities all across the country. However, although the majority of the startups known today are those that found success in climbing the barrier between idea and impact, it is the majority that fall short of overcoming this hurdle and end up failing as a product. In this report, we aim to look at a multitude of variables directly and intrinsically tied to startups and their growth, to determine the coefficient of correlation between various factors such as industry sector, funding, location, and size, and how they impact a startup's ability to come to fruition. Because the growth of startups is relatively new and tied to very modern technological advancements, there is a scarce amount of research done into the causes behind their success and failures. For example, venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as Y Combinator were founded in 2005, making the funding rounds for successful startups a very new principle. Our curiosity lies in looking at the underlying details of the successes and failures for startups in the United States, as it provides an opportunity to discover findings in a modern niche that does not possess the level of academic study that other corporate fields in America do.\n",

    "### Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset #1 – Crunchbase Startup Investments (to 2015)**  \n",
    "  This dataset has around 50,000 (39 variables) startup records with details on their funding size, industry, location, and company status. After cleaning the dataset (removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting funding amounts to numeric values), we created visuals such as top countries by total funding, funding amount distributions, and total VC funding over time. These results show that the U.S. dominates global funding, most startups raise relatively small amounts, and investment activity peaked around 2010–2012.  \n",
    "  Unfortunately, the dataset ends before 2015, which limits its relevance for very recent startup trends. Additionally, Crunchbase data is partly self‑reported/crowdsourced, which makes it prone to missing, biased, or inaccurate entries (especially outside U.S. and major tech hubs).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset #2 – Big Startup Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase**  \n",
    "  - Dataset Name: Big Startup Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase  \n",
    "  - Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yanmaksi/big-startup-secsees-fail-dataset-from-crunchbase  \n",
    "  - Number of observations: 24,182  \n",
    "  - Number of variables: 12  \n",
    "  - Description of the variables most relevant to this project:  \n",
    "    - Funding-related: `funding_total_usd`, `funding_rounds`, `first_funding_at`, `last_funding_at`  \n",
    "    - Outcome/status fields: `status` (operating, acquired, closed, ipo)  \n",
    "    - Company profile: `name`, `category_list`, `country_code`, `state_code`, `region`, `city`  \n",
    "    - Timing variables: `founded_at` and milestone event dates for computing time-to-failure or time-to-acquisition  \n",
    "  - Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project:  \n",
    "    - Potential label noise: status values may be outdated; “operating” does not guarantee long-term success; “closed” labels may lag behind real closure dates.  \n",
    "    - Missing or inconsistent date fields that complicate survival/time-to-event analysis.  \n",
    "    - Possible duplicates (companies appearing multiple times under variant naming).  \n",
    "    - Inconsistent or messy industry taxonomy in `category_list`.  \n",
    "    - Survivorship and reporting bias inherent to Crunchbase data (overrepresentation of certain regions and funded companies).  \n",
    "  This dataset will be cross‑examined alongside the others because our research question is multi‑faceted and depends on both funding dynamics and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset #3 – Startup Outcomes and Lifespan / Startup Failures datasets**  \n",
    "  These datasets document startup outcomes across multiple industries—Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information Technology, Manufacturing, and Retail—and serve as the foundation for analyzing how funding size, industry sector, and location affect a startup’s likelihood and timing of failure versus acquisition. Each record represents one startup and includes: \"Name\" – the company’s name; \"Years of Operation\" – the time span the startup was active; \"What They Did\" – a summary of the company’s primary product or service; \"How Much They Raised\" – total investor funding measured in U.S. dollars (millions); \"Why They Failed\" – a textual description of the main factor contributing to the company’s closure; and \"Takeaway\" – a concise lesson summarizing the insight learned from each company’s failure. These attributes allow us to explore patterns between financial backing, market type, and survival duration and to see whether greater funding or specific industries correlate with resilience or quicker acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Although these datasets provide valuable cross‑industry insight, they have several limitations. They focus only on startups that have failed, so they capture just one side of the entrepreneurial spectrum and overrepresent well‑documented, high‑profile companies (selection bias). As a result, smaller startups that failed quietly are likely missing, meaning our results mainly describe patterns among visible, well‑funded ventures rather than the “average” startup. The datasets also lack some quantitative details—such as geographic coordinates and detailed acquisition outcomes—that would enable a more complete analysis of survival.  \n",
    "  In terms of tidiness and cleaning, the data were mostly tidy from the start: each variable has its own column and each observation corresponds to a single startup. We mainly fixed spelling/capitalization, standardized formatting, and verified that key columns (like funding amounts) were consistently represented. Across the six sector‑specific files, there are about 409 unique observations representing startups that failed between 1992 and 2024. We kept sectors with enough observations to support meaningful comparisons and dropped rows only when absolutely necessary (e.g., to handle rare nulls or duplicates). Together, these cleaned files are saved in `data/02-processed/cleaned_dataset_3/` and combined into `Startup_Failures_clean.csv`, which we will use for cross‑sector failure and lifespan analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these three datasets let us study funding patterns (Dataset #1), large‑scale status outcomes and geography (Dataset #2), and detailed failure narratives and lifespans (Dataset #3), which we will align by company, sector, and time to address our research question."

    " - Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yanmaksi/big-startup-secsees-fail-dataset-from-crunchbase\n",
    " - Number of observations: Computed in the code cell below (after loading)\n",
    " - Number of variables: Computed in the code cell below (after loading)\n",
    " - Description of the variables most relevant to this project:\n",
    " - Funding-related: `funding_total_usd`, `funding_rounds`, `first_funding_at`, `last_funding_at`\n",
    " - Outcome/status fields: `status` (operating, acquired, closed, ipo)\n",
    " - Company profile: `name`, `category_list`, `country_code`, `state_code`, `region`, `city`\n",
    " - Timing variables: `founded_at` and milestone event dates for computing time-to-failure or time-to-acquisition\n",
    " - Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project:\n",
    " - Potential label noise: status values may be outdated; \"operating\" does not guarantee long-term success; \"closed\" labels may lag behind real closure dates\n",
    " - Missing or inconsistent date fields that complicate survival/time-to-event analysis\n",
    " - Possible duplicates (companies appearing multiple times under variant naming)\n",
    " - Inconsistent or messy industry taxonomy in `category_list`\n",
    " - Survivorship and reporting bias inherent to Crunchbase data (overrepresentation of certain regions and funded companies)\n",
    " - This will be crossexmained across all the datasets that we are using since our research quesiton is multi-faceted."

    "### Dataset #3 - Startup Outcomes and Lifespan Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets document startup outcomes across multiple industries—Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information Technology, Manufacturing, and Retail—and serve as the foundation for analyzing how funding size, industry sector, and location affect a startup’s likelihood and timing of failure versus acquisition. Each record represents one startup and includes: \"Name\" – the company’s name. \"Years of Operation\" – the time span the startup was active (in years). \"What They Did\" – a categorical summary of the company’s primary product or service. \"How Much They Raised\" – total investor funding measured in U.S. dollars (millions). For instance, $500M represents five hundred million dollars raised from venture capital or private investors. \"Why They Failed\" – a textual description of the main factor contributing to the company’s closure, such as competition, market shifts, regulatory pressure, or loss of funding. \"Takeaway\" – a concise lesson summarizing the insight learned from each company’s failure (e.g., “Crypto needs stability” or “Finance apps need edge”). These attributes allow us to explore patterns between financial backing, market type, and survival duration, revealing whether greater funding or specific industries correlate with resilience or quicker acquisition. By analyzing the timing between founding and shutdown years, we can quantify “startup lifespan” and compare it across sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these datasets provide valuable cross-industry insight, they are subject to several limitations. One main one is that the dataset only focuses on startups that have failed , meaning it only captures one side of the entrepreneurial spectrum. The data is sourced from CB Insights' \"Startup Failure Post-Mortem\" compilation, which highlights well documented and often high profile companies. Because of this, the sample is not random or representative of all startups which implies that smaller companies that failed quietly are likely missing. This creates a form of selection bias because of how our data only includes visible startups, so our results will mainly describe patterns among high-profile, well-funded ventures, not the average startup. While this selection bias limits the dataset’s ability to compare success versus failure rates directly, it does not invalidate its usefulness for the research question. Also, our dataset lacks certain quanatative details, for example, geographic coordinates and aquisition outcomes, that would allow for a more complete analysis of startup survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our dataset tidy, it was mainly tidy to begin with upon inspection. Every variable inside the dataset had its own column and each observation represented a single startup. There was not a single cell, hich contained multiple variables or lists, meaning the data was classified as tidy to begin with. A part from that, we fixed spelling/capitalization errors and overall formatting to make it more neat and feasible to utilize. Furthermore, across all six sector-specific datasets or files (Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information, Manufacturing, and Retail), there were a total of there were a total of 409 unqiue observations. Each observation that was included corresponded o one startup that failed between 1992 and 2024. We mainly focused on the six core sectors, which I previously mentioned beforehand, mainly because we wanted to ensure greater consistency, comparability, and data quality across industries. The remaining observations or entries were excluded because they either lacked sufficient information in key variables, or they represented industries with too few startups to extract menaingful insights out of. Moreover, a null-value check (df.isna().sum()) showed that the dataset had minimal missing values or data overall. Most columns were complete, with occassional missing entries in certain columns (like \"Takeaway\" and \"Why They Failed\"). These missing values would appear at random, as they did not correspond systematically to particular industries or funding rates. The main outliers in our dataset were checked in the \"How Much They Raise\" column through value inspection. Some companies were reported absurdily high funding of over and equal $1B, but these are legitimate outliers that represents large funded startups (like those in the finance sector). These values are primarily real rather than errors, they are kept to preserve the dataset's accuracy. Lastly, the datasets were generally clean and needed minor formatting changes (like adding underscores whenever there was a space, removing any trailing whitespace, and verifying all funding amounts using consistent dollar format). The dataset was nearly clean, complete, and missingness was very rare to begin with, so no rows were dropped. However, we still utilized the .dropna() just in case any null values were present, and we utlized the drop_duplicates to drop any duplicates that may have been present.\n",

    "Our exploratory data analysis focused on how funding, industry, geography, and network structure jointly shape startup outcomes, particularly acquisition versus closure. Across multiple visualizations, we consistently observed that higher funding levels are associated with higher acquisition rates, but that capital alone is not sufficient to guarantee survival. Sector-level trends showed that Consumer & Media and Software & Web startups tend to achieve the strongest “success trajectories,” while Life Sciences and other hardware-adjacent sectors exhibit more modest gains per funding tier. Network-based analyses revealed an even stronger relationship: startups with denser connections to “notable” individuals—board members, VC partners, experienced founders, and media contacts—show sharply higher acquisition rates, suggesting that relational capital amplifies the impact of financial capital.\n",
    "Geographic visualizations highlighted the outsized role of California and a handful of coastal states. California not only hosts the greatest density of startups but also contributes a disproportionate share of successful acquisitions, likely reflecting the concentration of venture capital firms, accelerators, and large tech incumbents. Survival-curve and failure-focused plots (e.g., the “valley of death” analysis) further showed that many well-funded startups still fail during a critical 3–7 year window, emphasizing that competition, execution, and market fit dominate beyond simple funding totals. Finally, comparison plots between acquired and closed companies demonstrated that while acquired startups have somewhat higher total funding and more rounds, the distributions overlap heavily—indicating that sustained fundraising momentum and strategic progression through later-stage rounds matter more than any single large check. All visualizations in this section were produced in RStudio using R; we intentionally do not include the underlying R code in this notebook, and instead focus here on documenting the resulting patterns, interpretations, and how they inform our subsequent modeling and analysis.\n",

    "Omar Graph 2: In order to build off of the aforementioned visualization regarding industry, funding, and success, our focus has concentrated onto the characteristics that lead to higher funding levels for domestic startups. One of those qualities/measurements is the network strength of these startups, which is measured by the total number of relationships to “notable” individuals. This system refers to the numerical count of how many documented relationships the startup has with sitting board members of larger enterprises, which can include executives at larger companies, advisors at venture capital firms, key executives such as other founders, as well as the total mentions and connections that the startup has to advertising branches and the press. The most notable takeaway from the visualization is that the relationship between network strength and acquisition rate has an even stronger positive linear correlation in comparison to funding and acquisition rate, and all sectors except for “other” show a positive linear correlation as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering the previous two visualizations holistically, the primary takeaway is that stronger funding and networks are highly correlated with a higher success rate, as measured by acquisition status. When considering the two from a logical standpoint, the primary takeaway would be that as funding and network strength work intrinsically to drive success of startups, founders and executives from startup companies with ideas at scale should be actively seeking the greatest opportunities to strengthen their networks and receive more funding for their scaling processes. These two work hand in hand, as stronger networks with venture capitalists and outside executives can not only directly lead to a greater influx of investment, but also opportunities for more recognition and interest from other executives and investors, creating a strong pipeline for investments and success moving forwards. One factor which we can further look into to understand how these startups look to maximize networks and funding together could be through where they are located during their production, as the surrounding environment is a massive gateway towards building connections and networks."

However, the most striking outcome from the visualization itself is the sheer magnitude of the volume of startups in California. While the ratio of success may be lower in total, they contribute over half of the total number of acquired startups in the United States. To tie this back into the original question of how funding, success, industry, and geographic location affect success, it can be inferred that California likely provides the best surrounding environment for startup success, primarily based upon greater opportunities for funding and stronger relationships. As California is home to multiple venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as YCombinator and Avenir Growth, alongside the Silicon Valley bank, it is no surprise that California has cultivated the stronger startup culture in the United States."

    "Omar Graph 5: The singular factor which we have not fully touched on yet is the industry sector. Here, we aim to depict the funding success of startups by industry, as well as the separation of the failed and successful startups by acquisition for each industry itself. The correlation between funding and success is once again prevalent, as the size of the squares on the treemap correlate to higher funding, and the acquired section takes up just over 75% of the axes in total. In relation to industries, however, the dominant industries for success are mobile, software, and web. An important note is that the “Mobile” sector includes any startup company that possesses a primary product launch through mobile-based platforms, mainly apps. Examples of these include DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Wire. These companies tend to be very highly funded, and also very successful. A secondary factor we can consider within this concept in relation to extrapolating our work into the future is conjuring how automation and the AI explosion over the past two years can impact these findings and trajectories. Certain industries such as advertising are already being siphoned by artificial intelligence based platforms, as Google and Meta Ads have become a hotspot for automation companies to sell algorithmic advertisement automation to consumers across the United States."

    "Zahir Graph: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) An initial examination of the dataset reveals distinct distributional characteristics across the primary variables. The temporal variable, Lifespan, follows a moderately right-skewed distribution (skewness: 0.67) with a central tendency leaning towards mid-stage failure; the mean duration is 7.5 years, closely aligning with a median of 7.0 years. In contrast, the Funding variable exhibits extreme positive skewness (skewness: >10), evidenced by a massive disparity between the median raised capital ($30M) and the mean ($190M). Outlier analysis utilizing the Interquartile Range (IQR) method confirms the presence of 53 significant \"capital outliers\"—companies that raised exceptional sums exceeding the calculated upper bound of $301.25M, with the most extreme case reaching $10.4B. When investigating the relationship between these variables, the bivariate analysis uncovers a surprising disconnect: the Pearson correlation coefficient between Funding and Lifespan is a negligible 0.067. This lack of linear association suggests that capital abundance is not a reliable predictor of longevity, as confirmed by a scatter plot visualization where well-funded \"unicorns\" frequently appear in the same early-failure clusters as their leaner counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical Approach & Findings To rigorously evaluate the dynamics of startup mortality,  employing the Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimator, a non-parametric statistic chosen for its ability to model time-to-event probabilities and account for the cumulative risk of failure over time, which offers superior insight compared to simple average lifespans. The analysis yielded a distinct \"Valley of Death Survival Curve,\" revealing that the probability of survival undergoes a decline specifically between Years 3 and 7, dropping from a secure 92% to a precarious 42%. Year 5 was identified as the single deadliest inflection point, accounting for 18.3% of all failures. My interpretation of these findings challenges the conventional wisdom that funding is the primary safety net; instead, the data indicates that the critical \"Valley\" period represents an operational crisis where startups must transition from burning capital to proving competitive dominance. The fact that 77% of failures cited \"Competition\" as a primary cause—regardless of funding levels—suggests that market positioning, rather than bank balance, is the true determinant of survival past the seven-year mark."

    "Yasir Graph (Correlation Heatmap) : Our correlation heatmap brings out the various interesting links that exist between funding attributes and the probability or timing of success or failure for the startup. One of the interesting links in the graphical representation is the association between “Has VC” and “Age at Last Funding.” This suggests that the probability of being funded by VCs means the startup stays in business for longer periods and generates more funding throughout the life span. Thus, being backed by VCs allows the startup to stay in business for more years before experiencing the end event of failure. Although, the heatmap displays that likelihood of being acquired is more deeply influenced with later stage funding rounds (Series A - D) rather than solely being associated with having VC, as the funding rounds show the stronger correlations with the “Status” variable. However, the link between “Has Angel” and “Age of Last Funding” & “Age of Last Milestone” suggests an inverse association and suggests that the startup funded by an angel achieves its funding milestone in its existence sooner. Thus, the startup stays for the same duration before being acquired or experiencing failure. However, the association in the graphical representation suggests that the startup backed by VCs stays longer in business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key takeaway is the significance of having “# Relationships” related to the funding in the later stages. Startups backed by Series B, C, D funding exhibit one of the top positive values for their numbers of partnerships and connections. This serves to highlight the point that advanced funding levels might correlate to having larger networks. Early funding-restricted companies (those that lack access to funding in the later stages but are in the early stage) fare poorly in building relationships. This goes to imply that their life span might be shorter. However, the correlation value between milestone timing and Series A-D funding turns out to be higher compared to the years of the span of the company. So, the advancement within the company might play an important part rather than the life span of the business indicated by the later funding milestones. Interestingly, the correlation between “Total Raised (USD)” and outcome/operational metrics appears to be rather weak, suggesting that the level of capital raised does not play a significant part in influencing the failure and acquisition of the startup. However, the correlative analysis of the heatmap appears to suggest that the level of funding (level of VC commitment or advancement from Series A through D funding, as explained previously) is rather influential in the determination of outcomes."

While there is a larger spread and greater variance for some older startups, (typically around 6- 15 years) there is not a reliable trend that shows that as the company ages, funding gets increased as a result. When looking at the data, it seems that the sector of the startup has higher influence than the years it has been active for. The FinTech, Social Media, and HealthTech sectors all consistently attract high funding, while sectors such as Gaming, E-commerce, and FoodTech attract lower amounts of funding apart from a few exceptions.

    "#### Acquired vs Closed Startups on Key Funding Metrics\n",
    "Mostafa: The graphs above compare startup funding amounts, number of funding rounds, and the final company outcomes between acquired and closed startups. A boxplot was ideal because it was the cleanest way of comparing medians and variability with skewed data that contained a lot of outliers. A log_10 transformation was applied to the values to compress the scale for clarity because of how wide the range of funding spans were. \n",
    "\n",
    "Total Funding is very right skewed and follows a log normal shape. Funding rounds are discrete, moderately skewed and most companies are between 1-5 rounds. Funding per round is very skewed because of differences in round sizes (log_10 was used to normalize it).\n",
    "\n",
    "All three variables contain extreme outliers, especially in total funding. Funding rounds shows a positive nonlinear relationship, where companies raising more rounds tend to secure higher total funding. Funding per round is weakly correlated with the outcome, where sustained fundraising momentum matters more than single round funds. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The results reveal a few somewhat surprising patterns; while it’s expected that acquired startups do typically raise more total funding and have more rounds, it’s only modestly higher, which suggests that sustained investor support (more rounds over time) matters more than the size of the check. Many closed startups raised very large amounts of money, often exceeding the levels of acquired firms, which shows that high funding doesn’t guarantee success. Additionally the distributions for acquired and closed companies overlap heavily in early stages, which tells us that early performance isn’t predictive and that meaningful divergence only appears after multiple rounds. These insights highlight that long term fundraising momentum, not early funding levels is the strongest signal correlated with eventual acquisition."

    "- **Bias & fairness:** Datasets may favor startups or sectors that are much higher in popularity and show a bias towards well known startups. There are also concerns with issues of generlzation as some areas may have high density of startups compared to others potential misrepresenting the data.\n",
    "- **Generalization limits:** As mentioned previously, Kaggle datasets in particular may overrepresent high success startups due to the ease of accessing the data. This results in the data not geenrlazaing to non-tech or smaller companies. We intend to avoid general claims and make specifc statements that are contextualized by environment maturity.\n",
    "- **Data sensitivity:** Although the data gathered is public, names and emails can be used to reidenifty an individual, or any specific data points that can be used to triangulate a person or startup. \n",
    "- **Non-Consensual Use of Company Information:** Despite the data being public, startups in the dataset did not consent to be analyzed or used for prediction exercises. We will be using aggregated analysis and not single out any companies.\n",
    "- **Potential Misrepresentation Due to Inaccurate or Incomplete Data:** Startup databases are often incomplete, outdated, or wrong because the data is crowdsourced. We will treat the data as approximate and emphasize uncertainty rather than presenting results as definitive truth.\n",
    "- **Responsibility to Prevent Harmful Use of Results:** If someone misuses the findings it may influence funding or hiring decisions, or perceptions of certain industries/regions. We will explicitly state that the work should not be used for investment decisions."

    "In regards to communication, we plan on using iMessage to text one another. We believe this is one of the most efficient and easiest ways for us to contact one another. As for the ,essaging itself, all members have agreed to expect a rresponse, whether that be a message or a reaction, from each group member within 3 hours of the initial text being sent. We will meet twice per week, every Monday morning we will reserve a study space in the Geisel Library to meet and prodvide updates, followed by a Zoom meetimng every Friday afternoon to consolidate the designated progress from Onday's meeting. In regarcs to tone, we agree to all expect respectful interactions. Even when disagreement takes place, the person expressing the lack of approval should explain their reasonibg, as well as an alkternative method that they beleive is better. We will be concise and to the point, but still maintaining respect for one another and everyone's ideas. We plan to use voting to make decisions as a group, especially for disagreements and changes to our original plan. The project administrator will be in charge of calling teh vote, ad we will go with the majority ruling, as wel have3 5 people. We will not accept abstaining from votes. We do have specialized roles for each person, hwoever, because there is overlap, we do plan to share a lot of the responsibilties. As we are a team, we plan on heloing each other out when possible, especially if one person is struggling with a specific task. We assign roles and tasks based on the skillsets of the members, which we have laready discussed in detail. We have set a policy that struggles are inevitbale, as we are all busy. We have a guideline that whenever someone is falling behind, there is no hassle or problem in expressing that as early as possible. We would rather know what to fix earlier on in the process, rather than have a last minute lack of execution. Struggles with certain tasks hoild be expressd immediately, as we will set egos aside ti help regardless of role/assignned tasks, in roder to priotitize the team as a unit/whole.\n"
