    "As the world continues to see the intersection of human ingenuity and technological accumulation grow extremely rapidly, this shift in the corporate landscape can be tied back to a specific niche: the prevalence and growth of startups in the post-modern era. As technical knowledge and tools continue to develop, human ingenuity has found itself employed in finding the most useful ways to leverage and expand upon the current era of technology and artificial intelligence. Examples of post-modern startups include Uber, Robinhood, Stripe, Databricks, Canva, and Slack. Ideas for growth and innovation stem from all fields, and are catalyzed from a variety of sources such as corporate America, educational insititutions, and small communities all across the country. However, although the majority of the startups known today are those that found success in climbing the barrier between idea and impact, it is the majority that fall short of overcoming this hurdle and end up failing as a product. In this report, we aim to look at a multitude of variables directly and intrinsically tied to startups and their growth, to determine the coefficient of correlation between various factors such as industry sector, funding, location, and size, and how they impact a startup's ability to come to fruition. Because the growth of startups is relatively new and tied to very modern technological advancements, there is a scarce amount of research done into the causes behind their success and failures. For example, venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as Y Combinator were founded in 2005, making the funding rounds for successful startups a very new principle. Our curiosity lies in looking at the underlying details of the successes and failures for startups in the United States, as it provides an opportunity to discover findings in a modern niche that does not possess the level of academic study that other corporate fields in America do."

    "This dataset contains observations of startup funding rounds with the following variables: company name, funding date, funding amount in USD, and investor. The dataset has been cleaned and transformed into tidy format, containing 50,000 funding round records from 36,866 unique companies across 3,653 unique dates (2015-07-14 to 2025-07-13). Funding amounts range from $3.93M to $61.04B, with a median of $439.83M. The dataset includes investments from 7 major VC firms: SoftBank, Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, Index Ventures, Accel, Y Combinator, and Sequoia, with each investor having approximately 7,000-7,300 investments. This dataset comprehensively allows us to answer the portion of our research question related to how funding affects the success of startups, by providing data points within funding amounts, dates, and investors. This dataset will be cross-examined with other datasets and observations to cross-check for the same companies across multiple sources for validity, as well as creating a more comprehensive composite metric including every variable: funding amount, funding date, and investor.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Synthetic Data**: This is simulated data, not real-world data, limiting generalizability of models and insights.\n",
    "2. **Limited Variables**: The cleaned dataset contains only 4 variables (company, funding_date, funding_amount_usd, investor), removing important information such as industry sector, geographic location, funding round type (Series A, B, C, etc.), exit status, and operational metrics that were present in the original dataset.\n",
    "3. **No Industry or Geographic Information**: The dataset lacks industry sector and geographic location data, making it impossible to analyze how funding patterns vary by industry or region, which is critical for understanding sector-specific success factors.\n",
    "4. **No Funding Round Type**: The dataset does not include the type of funding round (Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, IPO, Pre-Seed), making it impossible to analyze funding progression or understand the stage of development at which funding occurred.\n",
    "5. **No Exit Status**: The cleaned dataset removes exit status information, making it impossible to correlate funding patterns with startup success outcomes (IPO, acquisition, or closure).\n",
    "6. **Single Round per Record**: Each observation represents one funding round, not complete funding histories, making trajectory analysis difficult.\n",
    "7. **Limited Investor Diversity**: Only 7 major VC firms represented, missing angel investors, corporate VCs, and smaller funds.\n",
    "8. **Investor Transparency**: Lack of transparency from patent investors regarding total money raised in each series round. The dataset only shows individual funding round amounts but does not provide visibility into the complete funding picture per series, making it difficult to assess the true total capital raised across all rounds of the same series type.\n",
    "9. **Missing Series Progression Timeline**: The dataset does not include dates for the progression of different series rounds for the same startup. Without the ability to track when a startup moved from Series A to Series B to Series C, it is impossible to analyze the timing and sequence of funding rounds, which is critical for understanding startup development trajectories.\n",
    "10. **No Standardized Time Between Rounds**: There is no standardized time between funding rounds or between development stages and exit status. This makes it difficult to analyze typical development timelines, predict time-to-exit, or understand the relationship between funding frequency and startup success.\n",
    "11. **No Market Context**: Lacks macroeconomic indicators or industry trends at time of funding, important for predictive modeling.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Stale temporal coverage: The latest funding events stop in 2015, so post-2015 waves (AI, big data, climate tech) are absent, limiting relevance for contemporary benchmarking.\n",
    "2. Outcome blind spots: Revenues, profitability, and exit valuations are missing, preventing direct ROI or success/failure comparisons beyond funding activity.\n",
    "3. Geographic bias: By design the dataset keeps U.S. companies only, and those are concentrated in coastal hubs (SF Bay Area, NYC, Boston), underrepresenting inland and international ecosystems.\n",
    "4. Data quality quirks: Residual anomalies—such as placeholder hyphen entries or improbable dates (e.g., 1014-03-01)—require additional validation before modeling.\n",
    "5. Taxonomy drift: category_list mixes broad sectors with narrow niches, so analysts must normalize tags to avoid noisy or fragmented segment comparisons.\n"

    "  Some shortcomings with the dataset are that the dataset does not include certain important metrics such as employee count, location details, acquisition status, or time-to-failure in months, all of which could strengthen temporal or regional analyses. Secondly, the column “Why They Failed” condenses complex, multi-faceted causes into short summaries (e.g., “competition,” “cash flow issues”). This makes it difficult to capture nuanced or overlapping factors that contribute to business failure. Lastly, although the dataset focuses on failures, it provides limited data on successful startups or acquisitions, which restricts the ability to make direct comparisons between what leads to success versus failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Startup Outcomes & Lifespan Dataset is our guiding resource, we shall definitely employ this data in conjunction with other data sets focusing on quantitative detail regarding acquisition, source of funding, as well as location-based distribution. The present data set sets forth the basics in terms of definition, namely those that failed, amount of startup capital, as well as duration of existence, but subsidiary data sets may further detail this via acquisition statistics, startup location, as well as investor data sets, respectively. In exploring this data set in conjunction with data sets for investments in general, as well as geographies, a more analytical exploration of failure, rather than descriptive, could be undertaken to identify factors contributing to failure as well as acquisition, as this data set also provides insights into startups that acquire companies, in addition to those that fail, within the global startup community.\n",

    "These datasets rigorously document startup outcomes across multiple industries—Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information Technology, Manufacturing, and Retail—and form the bedrock for an analysis of how factors like funding size, industry sector, and location influence a startup's likelihood and timing of failure versus acquisition; each record represents one failed startup and includes its \"Name,\" \"Years of Operation,\" \"What They Did,\" \"How Much They Raised\" (total investor funding in U.S. dollars, millions, e.g., $500M), \"Why They Failed\" (a textual description of the main cause), and a \"Takeaway\" (a concise lesson summarizing the insight), attributes that enable the exploration of patterns between financial backing, market type, and survival duration to quantify and compare \"startup lifespan\" across sectors. Although these data provide valuable cross-industry insight, they are limited because they focus exclusively on failed startups sourced from CB Insights' \"Startup Failure Post-Mortem,\" which tends to highlight high-profile companies, creating a selection bias that primarily captures patterns among well-funded ventures rather than the average startup, and also lacks quantitative details like geographic coordinates or acquisition outcomes necessary for a complete survival analysis. To prepare the data, which was already tidy upon inspection with every variable having its own column and each observation representing a single startup, we fixed spelling and formatting errors, combined the six core sector files (Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information, Manufacturing, and Retail) to create a total of 409 unique observations, and excluded remaining entries that lacked sufficient information or belonged to industries with too few startups to extract meaningful insights. A check for null-values showed minimal missingness, appearing randomly in columns like \"Takeaway\" and \"Why They Failed,\" and while we checked absurdly high funding outliers (over or equal to $1B) in the \"How Much They Raise\" column, we kept them as they were determined to be legitimate values representing large, real-world funded startups; finally, the nearly clean dataset required only minor formatting adjustments, like adding underscores or removing trailing whitespace, and while no rows were dropped due to the scarcity of missingness, we utilized `.dropna()` and `.drop_duplicates()` just in case any null values or duplicates were present.\n",

    "Our exploratory data analysis focused on how funding, industry, geography, and network structure jointly shape startup outcomes, particularly acquisition versus closure. Across multiple visualizations, we consistently observed that higher funding levels are associated with higher acquisition rates, but that capital alone is not sufficient to guarantee survival. Sector-level trends showed that Consumer & Media and Software & Web startups tend to achieve the strongest “success trajectories,” while Life Sciences and other hardware-adjacent sectors exhibit more modest gains per funding tier. Network-based analyses revealed an even stronger relationship: startups with denser connections to “notable” individuals—board members, VC partners, experienced founders, and media contacts—show sharply higher acquisition rates, suggesting that relational capital amplifies the impact of financial capital.\n",
    "Geographic visualizations highlighted the outsized role of California and a handful of coastal states. California not only hosts the greatest density of startups but also contributes a disproportionate share of successful acquisitions, likely reflecting the concentration of venture capital firms, accelerators, and large tech incumbents. Survival-curve and failure-focused plots (e.g., the “valley of death” analysis) further showed that many well-funded startups still fail during a critical 3–7 year window, emphasizing that competition, execution, and market fit dominate beyond simple funding totals. Finally, comparison plots between acquired and closed companies demonstrated that while acquired startups have somewhat higher total funding and more rounds, the distributions overlap heavily—indicating that sustained fundraising momentum and strategic progression through later-stage rounds matter more than any single large check. All visualizations in this section were produced in RStudio using R; we intentionally do not include the underlying R code in this notebook, and instead focus here on documenting the resulting patterns, interpretations, and how they inform our subsequent modeling and analysis.\n",

    "Omar Graph 2: In order to build off of the aforementioned visualization regarding industry, funding, and success, our focus has concentrated onto the characteristics that lead to higher funding levels for domestic startups. One of those qualities/measurements is the network strength of these startups, which is measured by the total number of relationships to “notable” individuals. This system refers to the numerical count of how many documented relationships the startup has with sitting board members of larger enterprises, which can include executives at larger companies, advisors at venture capital firms, key executives such as other founders, as well as the total mentions and connections that the startup has to advertising branches and the press. The most notable takeaway from the visualization is that the relationship between network strength and acquisition rate has an even stronger positive linear correlation in comparison to funding and acquisition rate, and all sectors except for “other” show a positive linear correlation as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering the previous two visualizations holistically, the primary takeaway is that stronger funding and networks are highly correlated with a higher success rate, as measured by acquisition status. When considering the two from a logical standpoint, the primary takeaway would be that as funding and network strength work intrinsically to drive success of startups, founders and executives from startup companies with ideas at scale should be actively seeking the greatest opportunities to strengthen their networks and receive more funding for their scaling processes. These two work hand in hand, as stronger networks with venture capitalists and outside executives can not only directly lead to a greater influx of investment, but also opportunities for more recognition and interest from other executives and investors, creating a strong pipeline for investments and success moving forwards. One factor which we can further look into to understand how these startups look to maximize networks and funding together could be through where they are located during their production, as the surrounding environment is a massive gateway towards building connections and networks."

While the ratio of success may be lower in total, they contribute over half of the total number of acquired startups in the United States. To tie this back into the original question of how funding, success, industry, and geographic location affect success, it can be inferred that California likely provides the best surrounding environment for startup success, primarily based upon greater opportunities for funding and stronger relationships. As California is home to multiple venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as YCombinator and Avenir Growth, alongside the Silicon Valley bank, it is no surprise that California has cultivated the stronger startup culture in the United States."

Here, we aim to depict the funding success of startups by industry, as well as the separation of the failed and successful startups by acquisition for each industry itself. The correlation between funding and success is once again prevalent, as the size of the squares on the treemap correlate to higher funding, and the acquired section takes up just over 75% of the axes in total. In relation to industries, however, the dominant industries for success are mobile, software, and web. An important note is that the “Mobile” sector includes any startup company that possesses a primary product launch through mobile-based platforms, mainly apps. Examples of these include DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Wire. These companies tend to be very highly funded, and also very successful. A secondary factor we can consider within this concept in relation to extrapolating our work into the future is conjuring how automation and the AI explosion over the past two years can impact these findings and trajectories. Certain industries such as advertising are already being siphoned by artificial intelligence based platforms, as Google and Meta Ads have become a hotspot for automation companies to sell algorithmic advertisement automation to consumers across the United States."

    "Zahir Graph: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) An initial examination of the dataset reveals distinct distributional characteristics across the primary variables. The temporal variable, Lifespan, follows a moderately right-skewed distribution (skewness: 0.67) with a central tendency leaning towards mid-stage failure; the mean duration is 7.5 years, closely aligning with a median of 7.0 years. In contrast, the Funding variable exhibits extreme positive skewness (skewness: >10), evidenced by a massive disparity between the median raised capital ($30M) and the mean ($190M). Outlier analysis utilizing the Interquartile Range (IQR) method confirms the presence of 53 significant \"capital outliers\"—companies that raised exceptional sums exceeding the calculated upper bound of $301.25M, with the most extreme case reaching $10.4B. When investigating the relationship between these variables, the bivariate analysis uncovers a surprising disconnect: the Pearson correlation coefficient between Funding and Lifespan is a negligible 0.067. This lack of linear association suggests that capital abundance is not a reliable predictor of longevity, as confirmed by a scatter plot visualization where well-funded \"unicorns\" frequently appear in the same early-failure clusters as their leaner counterparts.\n",

    "Analytical Approach & Findings To rigorously evaluate the dynamics of startup mortality,  employing the Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimator, a non-parametric statistic chosen for its ability to model time-to-event probabilities and account for the cumulative risk of failure over time, which offers superior insight compared to simple average lifespans. The analysis yielded a distinct \"Valley of Death Survival Curve,\" revealing that the probability of survival undergoes a decline specifically between Years 3 and 7, dropping from a secure 92% to a precarious 42%. Year 5 was identified as the single deadliest inflection point, accounting for 18.3% of all failures. My interpretation of these findings challenges the conventional wisdom that funding is the primary safety net; instead, the data indicates that the critical \"Valley\" period represents an operational crisis where startups must transition from burning capital to proving competitive dominance. The fact that 77% of failures cited \"Competition\" as a primary cause—regardless of funding levels—suggests that market positioning, rather than bank balance, is the true determinant of survival past the seven-year mark."

    "Yasir Graph (Correlation Heatmap) : Our correlation heatmap brings out the various interesting links that exist between funding attributes and the probability or timing of success or failure for the startup. One of the interesting links in the graphical representation is the association between “Has VC” and “Age at Last Funding.” This suggests that the probability of being funded by VCs means the startup stays in business for longer periods and generates more funding throughout the life span. Thus, being backed by VCs allows the startup to stay in business for more years before experiencing the end event of failure. Although, the heatmap displays that likelihood of being acquired is more deeply influenced with later stage funding rounds (Series A - D) rather than solely being associated with having VC, as the funding rounds show the stronger correlations with the “Status” variable. However, the link between “Has Angel” and “Age of Last Funding” & “Age of Last Milestone” suggests an inverse association and suggests that the startup funded by an angel achieves its funding milestone in its existence sooner. Thus, the startup stays for the same duration before being acquired or experiencing failure. However, the association in the graphical representation suggests that the startup backed by VCs stays longer in business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key takeaway is the significance of having “# Relationships” related to the funding in the later stages. Startups backed by Series B, C, D funding exhibit one of the top positive values for their numbers of partnerships and connections. This serves to highlight the point that advanced funding levels might correlate to having larger networks. Early funding-restricted companies (those that lack access to funding in the later stages but are in the early stage) fare poorly in building relationships. This goes to imply that their life span might be shorter. However, the correlation value between milestone timing and Series A-D funding turns out to be higher compared to the years of the span of the company. So, the advancement within the company might play an important part rather than the life span of the business indicated by the later funding milestones. Interestingly, the correlation between “Total Raised (USD)” and outcome/operational metrics appears to be rather weak, suggesting that the level of capital raised does not play a significant part in influencing the failure and acquisition of the startup. However, the correlative analysis of the heatmap appears to suggest that the level of funding (level of VC commitment or advancement from Series A through D funding, as explained previously) is rather influential in the determination of outcomes."

    "Adam Graph (2D Scatter-Plot): The scatter plot above shows a poor relationship between how much funding a startup gets and how long they have been operating for. While there is a larger spread and greater variance for some older startups, (typically around 6- 15 years) there is not a reliable trend that shows that as the company ages, funding gets increased as a result. When looking at the data, it seems that the sector of the startup has higher influence than the years it has been active for. The FinTech, Social Media, and HealthTech sectors all consistently attract high funding, while sectors such as Gaming, E-commerce, and FoodTech attract lower amounts of funding apart from a few exceptions. This indicates that sector choice is a higher indicator of funding size than company age."

    "Mostafa: The graphs above compare startup funding amounts, number of funding rounds, and the final company outcomes between acquired and closed startups. A boxplot was ideal because it was the cleanest way of comparing medians and variability with skewed data that contained a lot of outliers. A log_10 transformation was applied to the values to compress the scale for clarity because of how wide the range of funding spans were. \n",
    "\n",
    "Total Funding is very right skewed and follows a log normal shape. Funding rounds are discrete, moderately skewed and most companies are between 1-5 rounds. Funding per round is very skewed because of differences in round sizes (log_10 was used to normalize it).\n",
    "\n",
    "All three variables contain extreme outliers, especially in total funding. Funding rounds shows a positive nonlinear relationship, where companies raising more rounds tend to secure higher total funding. Funding per round is weakly correlated with the outcome, where sustained fundraising momentum matters more than single round funds. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The results reveal a few somewhat surprising patterns; while it’s expected that acquired startups do typically raise more total funding and have more rounds, it’s only modestly higher, which suggests that sustained investor support (more rounds over time) matters more than the size of the check. Many closed startups raised very large amounts of money, often exceeding the levels of acquired firms, which shows that high funding doesn’t guarantee success. Additionally the distributions for acquired and closed companies overlap heavily in early stages, which tells us that early performance isn’t predictive and that meaningful divergence only appears after multiple rounds. These insights highlight that long term fundraising momentum, not early funding levels is the strongest signal correlated with eventual acquisition."

    "In regards to communication, we plan on using iMessage to text one another. We believe this is one of the most efficient and easiest ways for us to contact one another. As for the ,essaging itself, all members have agreed to expect a rresponse, whether that be a message or a reaction, from each group member within 3 hours of the initial text being sent. We will meet twice per week, every Monday morning we will reserve a study space in the Geisel Library to meet and prodvide updates, followed by a Zoom meetimng every Friday afternoon to consolidate the designated progress from Onday's meeting. In regarcs to tone, we agree to all expect respectful interactions. Even when disagreement takes place, the person expressing the lack of approval should explain their reasonibg, as well as an alkternative method that they beleive is better. We will be concise and to the point, but still maintaining respect for one another and everyone's ideas. We plan to use voting to make decisions as a group, especially for disagreements and changes to our original plan. The project administrator will be in charge of calling teh vote, ad we will go with the majority ruling, as wel have3 5 people. We will not accept abstaining from votes. We do have specialized roles for each person, hwoever, because there is overlap, we do plan to share a lot of the responsibilties. As we are a team, we plan on heloing each other out when possible, especially if one person is struggling with a specific task. We assign roles and tasks based on the skillsets of the members, which we have laready discussed in detail. We have set a policy that struggles are inevitbale, as we are all busy. We have a guideline that whenever someone is falling behind, there is no hassle or problem in expressing that as early as possible. We would rather know what to fix earlier on in the process, rather than have a last minute lack of execution. Struggles with certain tasks hoild be expressd immediately, as we will set egos aside ti help regardless of role/assignned tasks, in roder to priotitize the team as a unit/whole.\n"
