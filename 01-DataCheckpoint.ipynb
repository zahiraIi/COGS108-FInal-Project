    "As the world continues to see the intersection of human ingenuity and technological accumulation grow extremely rapidly, this shift in the corporate landscape can be tied back to a specific niche: the prevalence and growth of startups in the post-modern era. As technical knowledge and tools continue to develop, human ingenuity has found itself employed in finding the most useful ways to leverage and expand upon the current era of technology and artificial intelligence. Examples of post-modern startups include Uber, Robinhood, Stripe, Databricks, Canva, and Slack. Ideas for growth and innovation stem from all fields, and are catalyzed from a variety of sources such as corporate America, educational insititutions, and small communities all across the country. However, although the majority of the startups known today are those that found success in climbing the barrier between idea and impact, it is the majority that fall short of overcoming this hurdle and end up failing as a product. In this report, we aim to look at a multitude of variables directly and intrinsically tied to startups and their growth, to determine the coefficient of correlation between various factors such as industry sector, funding, location, and size, and how they impact a startup's ability to come to fruition. Because the growth of startups is relatively new and tied to very modern technological advancements, there is a scarce amount of research done into the causes behind their success and failures. For example, venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as Y Combinator were founded in 2005, making the funding rounds for successful startups a very new principle. Our curiosity lies in looking at the underlying details of the successes and failures for startups in the United States, as it provides an opportunity to discover findings in a modern niche that does not possess the level of academic study that other corporate fields in America do."

    "This dataset contains observations of startup funding rounds with the following variables: company name, funding date, funding amount in USD, and investor. The dataset has been cleaned and transformed into tidy format, containing 50,000 funding round records from 36,866 unique companies across 3,653 unique dates (2015-07-14 to 2025-07-13). Funding amounts range from $3.93M to $61.04B, with a median of $439.83M. The dataset includes investments from 7 major VC firms: SoftBank, Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, Index Ventures, Accel, Y Combinator, and Sequoia, with each investor having approximately 7,000-7,300 investments. This dataset comprehensively allows us to answer the portion of our research question related to how funding affects the success of startups, by providing data points within funding amounts, dates, and investors. This dataset will be cross-examined with other datasets and observations to cross-check for the same companies across multiple sources for validity, as well as creating a more comprehensive composite metric including every variable: funding amount, funding date, and investor.\n",

    "- `funding_amount_usd`: Funding amount in USD (range: $3.93M-$61.04B, median: $439.83M, mean: $811.93M)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Synthetic Data**: This is simulated data, not real-world data, limiting generalizability of models and insights.\n",
    "2. **Limited Variables**: The cleaned dataset contains only 4 variables (company, funding_date, funding_amount_usd, investor), removing important information such as industry sector, geographic location, funding round type (Series A, B, C, etc.), exit status, and operational metrics that were present in the original dataset.\n",
    "3. **No Industry or Geographic Information**: The dataset lacks industry sector and geographic location data, making it impossible to analyze how funding patterns vary by industry or region, which is critical for understanding sector-specific success factors.\n",
    "4. **No Funding Round Type**: The dataset does not include the type of funding round (Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, IPO, Pre-Seed), making it impossible to analyze funding progression or understand the stage of development at which funding occurred.\n",
    "5. **No Exit Status**: The cleaned dataset removes exit status information, making it impossible to correlate funding patterns with startup success outcomes (IPO, acquisition, or closure).\n",
    "6. **Single Round per Record**: Each observation represents one funding round, not complete funding histories, making trajectory analysis difficult.\n",
    "7. **Limited Investor Diversity**: Only 7 major VC firms represented, missing angel investors, corporate VCs, and smaller funds.\n",
    "8. **Investor Transparency**: Lack of transparency from patent investors regarding total money raised in each series round. The dataset only shows individual funding round amounts but does not provide visibility into the complete funding picture per series, making it difficult to assess the true total capital raised across all rounds of the same series type.\n",
    "9. **Missing Series Progression Timeline**: The dataset does not include dates for the progression of different series rounds for the same startup. Without the ability to track when a startup moved from Series A to Series B to Series C, it is impossible to analyze the timing and sequence of funding rounds, which is critical for understanding startup development trajectories.\n",
    "10. **No Standardized Time Between Rounds**: There is no standardized time between funding rounds or between development stages and exit status. This makes it difficult to analyze typical development timelines, predict time-to-exit, or understand the relationship between funding frequency and startup success.\n",
    "11. **No Market Context**: Lacks macroeconomic indicators or industry trends at time of funding, important for predictive modeling.\n",

    "  Some shortcomings with the dataset are that the dataset does not include certain important metrics such as employee count, location details, acquisition status, or time-to-failure in months, all of which could strengthen temporal or regional analyses. Secondly, the column \"Why They Failed\" condenses complex, multi-faceted causes into short summaries (e.g., \"competition,\" \"cash flow issues\"). This makes it difficult to capture nuanced or overlapping factors that contribute to business failure. Lastly, although the dataset focuses on failures, it provides limited data on successful startups or acquisitions, which restricts the ability to make direct comparisons between what leads to success versus failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Startup Outcomes & Lifespan Dataset is our guiding resource, we shall definitely employ this data in conjunction with other data sets focusing on quantitative detail regarding acquisition, source of funding, as well as location-based distribution. The present data set sets forth the basics in terms of definition, namely those that failed, amount of startup capital, as well as duration of existence, but subsidiary data sets may further detail this via acquisition statistics, startup location, as well as investor data sets, respectively. In exploring this data set in conjunction with data sets for investments in general, as well as geographies, a more analytical exploration of failure, rather than descriptive, could be undertaken to identify factors contributing to failure as well as acquisition, as this data set also provides insights into startups that acquire companies, in addition to those that fail, within the global startup community.\n",

    "### Dataset #3 - Startup Outcomes and Lifespan Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets rigorously document startup outcomes across multiple industries—Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information Technology, Manufacturing, and Retail—and form the bedrock for an analysis of how factors like funding size, industry sector, and location influence a startup's likelihood and timing of failure versus acquisition; each record represents one failed startup and includes its \"Name,\" \"Years of Operation,\" \"What They Did,\" \"How Much They Raised\" (total investor funding in U.S. dollars, millions, e.g., $500M), \"Why They Failed\" (a textual description of the main cause), and a \"Takeaway\" (a concise lesson summarizing the insight), attributes that enable the exploration of patterns between financial backing, market type, and survival duration to quantify and compare \"startup lifespan\" across sectors. Although these data provide valuable cross-industry insight, they are limited because they focus exclusively on failed startups sourced from CB Insights' \"Startup Failure Post-Mortem,\" which tends to highlight high-profile companies, creating a selection bias that primarily captures patterns among well-funded ventures rather than the average startup, and also lacks quantitative details like geographic coordinates or acquisition outcomes necessary for a complete survival analysis. To prepare the data, which was already tidy upon inspection with every variable having its own column and each observation representing a single startup, we fixed spelling and formatting errors, combined the six core sector files (Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information, Manufacturing, and Retail) to create a total of 409 unique observations, and excluded remaining entries that lacked sufficient information or belonged to industries with too few startups to extract meaningful insights. A check for null-values showed minimal missingness, appearing randomly in columns like \"Takeaway\" and \"Why They Failed,\" and while we checked absurdly high funding outliers (over or equal to $1B) in the \"How Much They Raise\" column, we kept them as they were determined to be legitimate values representing large, real-world funded startups; finally, the nearly clean dataset required only minor formatting adjustments, like adding underscores or removing trailing whitespace, and while no rows were dropped due to the scarcity of missingness, we utilized `.dropna()` and `.drop_duplicates()` just in case any null values or duplicates were present.\n",
