    "As the world continues to see the intersection of human ingenuity and technological accumulation grow extremely rapidly, this shift in the corporate landscape can be tied back to a specific niche: the prevalence and growth of startups in the post-modern era. As technical knowledge and tools continue to develop, human ingenuity has found itself employed in finding the most useful ways to leverage and expand upon the current era of technology and artificial intelligence. Examples of post-modern startups include Uber, Robinhood, Stripe, Databricks, Canva, and Slack. Ideas for growth and innovation stem from all fields, and are catalyzed from a variety of sources such as corporate America, educational insititutions, and small communities all across the country. However, although the majority of the startups known today are those that found success in climbing the barrier between idea and impact, it is the majority that fall short of overcoming this hurdle and end up failing as a product. In this report, we aim to look at a multitude of variables directly and intrinsically tied to startups and their growth, to determine the coefficient of correlation between various factors such as industry sector, funding, location, and size, and how they impact a startup's ability to come to fruition. Because the growth of startups is relatively new and tied to very modern technological advancements, there is a scarce amount of research done into the causes behind their success and failures. For example, venture capital firms and startup accelerators such as Y Combinator were founded in 2005, making the funding rounds for successful startups a very new principle. Our curiosity lies in looking at the underlying details of the successes and failures for startups in the United States, as it provides an opportunity to discover findings in a modern niche that does not possess the level of academic study that other corporate fields in America do."

    "  Some shortcomings with the dataset are that the dataset does not include certain important metrics such as employee count, location details, acquisition status, or time-to-failure in months, all of which could strengthen temporal or regional analyses. Secondly, the column “Why They Failed” condenses complex, multi-faceted causes into short summaries (e.g., “competition,” “cash flow issues”). This makes it difficult to capture nuanced or overlapping factors that contribute to business failure. Lastly, although the dataset focuses on failures, it provides limited data on successful startups or acquisitions, which restricts the ability to make direct comparisons between what leads to success versus failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Startup Outcomes & Lifespan Dataset is our guiding resource, we shall definitely employ this data in conjunction with other data sets focusing on quantitative detail regarding acquisition, source of funding, as well as location-based distribution. The present data set sets forth the basics in terms of definition, namely those that failed, amount of startup capital, as well as duration of existence, but subsidiary data sets may further detail this via acquisition statistics, startup location, as well as investor data sets, respectively. In exploring this data set in conjunction with data sets for investments in general, as well as geographies, a more analytical exploration of failure, rather than descriptive, could be undertaken to identify factors contributing to failure as well as acquisition, as this data set also provides insights into startups that acquire companies, in addition to those that fail, within the global startup community.\n",

    "### Dataset #3 - Startup Outcomes and Lifespan Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets rigorously document startup outcomes across multiple industries—Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information Technology, Manufacturing, and Retail—and form the bedrock for an analysis of how factors like funding size, industry sector, and location influence a startup's likelihood and timing of failure versus acquisition; each record represents one failed startup and includes its \"Name,\" \"Years of Operation,\" \"What They Did,\" \"How Much They Raised\" (total investor funding in U.S. dollars, millions, e.g., $500M), \"Why They Failed\" (a textual description of the main cause), and a \"Takeaway\" (a concise lesson summarizing the insight), attributes that enable the exploration of patterns between financial backing, market type, and survival duration to quantify and compare \"startup lifespan\" across sectors. Although these data provide valuable cross-industry insight, they are limited because they focus exclusively on failed startups sourced from CB Insights' \"Startup Failure Post-Mortem,\" which tends to highlight high-profile companies, creating a selection bias that primarily captures patterns among well-funded ventures rather than the average startup, and also lacks quantitative details like geographic coordinates or acquisition outcomes necessary for a complete survival analysis. To prepare the data, which was already tidy upon inspection with every variable having its own column and each observation representing a single startup, we fixed spelling and formatting errors, combined the six core sector files (Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information, Manufacturing, and Retail) to create a total of 409 unique observations, and excluded remaining entries that lacked sufficient information or belonged to industries with too few startups to extract meaningful insights. A check for null-values showed minimal missingness, appearing randomly in columns like \"Takeaway\" and \"Why They Failed,\" and while we checked absurdly high funding outliers (over or equal to $1B) in the \"How Much They Raise\" column, we kept them as they were determined to be legitimate values representing large, real-world funded startups; finally, the nearly clean dataset required only minor formatting adjustments, like adding underscores or removing trailing whitespace, and while no rows were dropped due to the scarcity of missingness, we utilized `.dropna()` and `.drop_duplicates()` just in case any null values or duplicates were present.\n",

    "- **Bias & fairness:** Datasets may favor startups or sectors that are much higher in popularity and show a bias towards well known startups. There are also concerns with issues of generlzation as some areas may have high density of startups compared to others potential misrepresenting the data.\n",
    "- **Generalization limits:** As mentioned previously, Kaggle datasets in particular may overrepresent high success startups due to the ease of accessing the data. This results in the data not geenrlazaing to non-tech or smaller companies. We intend to avoid general claims and make specifc statements that are contextualized by environment maturity.\n",
    "- **Data sensitivity:** Although the data gathered is public, names and emails can be used to reidenifty an individual, or any specific data points that can be used to triangulate a person or startup. \n",
    "- **Non-Consensual Use of Company Information:** Despite the data being public, startups in the dataset did not consent to be analyzed or used for prediction exercises. We will be using aggregated analysis and not single out any companies.\n",
    "- **Potential Misrepresentation Due to Inaccurate or Incomplete Data:** Startup databases are often incomplete, outdated, or wrong because the data is crowdsourced. We will treat the data as approximate and emphasize uncertainty rather than presenting results as definitive truth.\n",
    "- **Responsibility to Prevent Harmful Use of Results:** If someone misuses the findings it may influence funding or hiring decisions, or perceptions of certain industries/regions. We will explicitly state that the work should not be used for investment decisions."

    "In regards to communication, we plan on using iMessage to text one another. We believe this is one of the most efficient and easiest ways for us to contact one another. As for the ,essaging itself, all members have agreed to expect a rresponse, whether that be a message or a reaction, from each group member within 3 hours of the initial text being sent. We will meet twice per week, every Monday morning we will reserve a study space in the Geisel Library to meet and prodvide updates, followed by a Zoom meetimng every Friday afternoon to consolidate the designated progress from Onday's meeting. In regarcs to tone, we agree to all expect respectful interactions. Even when disagreement takes place, the person expressing the lack of approval should explain their reasonibg, as well as an alkternative method that they beleive is better. We will be concise and to the point, but still maintaining respect for one another and everyone's ideas. We plan to use voting to make decisions as a group, especially for disagreements and changes to our original plan. The project administrator will be in charge of calling teh vote, ad we will go with the majority ruling, as wel have3 5 people. We will not accept abstaining from votes. We do have specialized roles for each person, hwoever, because there is overlap, we do plan to share a lot of the responsibilties. As we are a team, we plan on heloing each other out when possible, especially if one person is struggling with a specific task. We assign roles and tasks based on the skillsets of the members, which we have laready discussed in detail. We have set a policy that struggles are inevitbale, as we are all busy. We have a guideline that whenever someone is falling behind, there is no hassle or problem in expressing that as early as possible. We would rather know what to fix earlier on in the process, rather than have a last minute lack of execution. Struggles with certain tasks hoild be expressd immediately, as we will set egos aside ti help regardless of role/assignned tasks, in roder to priotitize the team as a unit/whole.\n"
