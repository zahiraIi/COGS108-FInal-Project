    "  Some shortcomings with the dataset are that the dataset does not include certain important metrics such as employee count, location details, acquisition status, or time-to-failure in months, all of which could strengthen temporal or regional analyses. Secondly, the column “Why They Failed” condenses complex, multi-faceted causes into short summaries (e.g., “competition,” “cash flow issues”). This makes it difficult to capture nuanced or overlapping factors that contribute to business failure. Lastly, although the dataset focuses on failures, it provides limited data on successful startups or acquisitions, which restricts the ability to make direct comparisons between what leads to success versus failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Startup Outcomes & Lifespan Dataset is our guiding resource, we shall definitely employ this data in conjunction with other data sets focusing on quantitative detail regarding acquisition, source of funding, as well as location-based distribution. The present data set sets forth the basics in terms of definition, namely those that failed, amount of startup capital, as well as duration of existence, but subsidiary data sets may further detail this via acquisition statistics, startup location, as well as investor data sets, respectively. In exploring this data set in conjunction with data sets for investments in general, as well as geographies, a more analytical exploration of failure, rather than descriptive, could be undertaken to identify factors contributing to failure as well as acquisition, as this data set also provides insights into startups that acquire companies, in addition to those that fail, within the global startup community.\n",

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

    "### Dataset #4 - Startup Outcomes and Lifespan Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets document startup outcomes across multiple industries—Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information Technology, Manufacturing, and Retail—and serve as the foundation for analyzing how funding size, industry sector, and location affect a startup’s likelihood and timing of failure versus acquisition. Each record represents one startup and includes: \"Name\" – the company’s name. \"Years of Operation\" – the time span the startup was active (in years). \"What They Did\" – a categorical summary of the company’s primary product or service. \"How Much They Raised\" – total investor funding measured in U.S. dollars (millions). For instance, $500M represents five hundred million dollars raised from venture capital or private investors. \"Why They Failed\" – a textual description of the main factor contributing to the company’s closure, such as competition, market shifts, regulatory pressure, or loss of funding. \"Takeaway\" – a concise lesson summarizing the insight learned from each company’s failure (e.g., “Crypto needs stability” or “Finance apps need edge”). These attributes allow us to explore patterns between financial backing, market type, and survival duration, revealing whether greater funding or specific industries correlate with resilience or quicker acquisition. By analyzing the timing between founding and shutdown years, we can quantify “startup lifespan” and compare it across sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these datasets provide valuable cross-industry insight, they are subject to several limitations. One main one is that the dataset only focuses on startups that have failed , meaning it only captures one side of the entrepreneurial spectrum. The data is sourced from CB Insights' \"Startup Failure Post-Mortem\" compilation, which highlights well documented and often high profile companies. Because of this, the sample is not random or representative of all startups which implies that smaller companies that failed quietly are likely missing. This creates a form of selection bias because of how our data only includes visible startups, so our results will mainly describe patterns among high-profile, well-funded ventures, not the average startup. While this selection bias limits the dataset’s ability to compare success versus failure rates directly, it does not invalidate its usefulness for the research question. Also, our dataset lacks certain quanatative details, for example, geographic coordinates and aquisition outcomes, that would allow for a more complete analysis of startup survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our dataset tidy, it was mainly tidy to begin with upon inspection. Every variable inside the dataset had its own column and each observation represented a single startup. There was not a single cell, hich contained multiple variables or lists, meaning the data was classified as tidy to begin with. A part from that, we fixed spelling/capitalization errors and overall formatting to make it more neat and feasible to utilize. Furthermore, across all six sector-specific datasets or files (Finance, Food, Healthcare, Information, Manufacturing, and Retail), there were a total of there were a total of 409 unqiue observations. Each observation that was included corresponded o one startup that failed between 1992 and 2024. We mainly focused on the six core sectors, which I previously mentioned beforehand, mainly because we wanted to ensure greater consistency, comparability, and data quality across industries. The remaining observations or entries were excluded because they either lacked sufficient information in key variables, or they represented industries with too few startups to extract menaingful insights out of. Moreover, a null-value check (df.isna().sum()) showed that the dataset had minimal missing values or data overall. Most columns were complete, with occassional missing entries in certain columns (like \"Takeaway\" and \"Why They Failed\"). These missing values would appear at random, as they did not correspond systematically to particular industries or funding rates. The main outliers in our dataset were checked in the \"How Much They Raise\" column through value inspection. Some companies were reported absurdily high funding of over and equal $1B, but these are legitimate outliers that represents large funded startups (like those in the finance sector). These values are primarily real rather than errors, they are kept to preserve the dataset's accuracy. Lastly, the datasets were generally clean and needed minor formatting changes (like adding underscores whenever there was a space, removing any trailing whitespace, and verifying all funding amounts using consistent dollar format). The dataset was nearly clean, complete, and missingness was very rare to begin with, so no rows were dropped. However, we still utilized the .dropna() just in case any null values were present, and we utlized the drop_duplicates to drop any duplicates that may have been present.\n",
